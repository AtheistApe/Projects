# The 'sed' s (substitute) command.

syntax: sed 's/old/new' file

where:
* 'sed' invokes the sed program,
* 's' is to substitute the 'old' text for the 'new' text in the file 'file'.

## Example
```
gary@gary-VirtualBox ~/Projects/SED $ cat dukeofyork.txt
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
And he marched them down again
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down
```
```
gary@gary-VirtualBox ~/Projects/SED $ sed 's/the/THE/' dukeofyork.txt

And when THEy were up they were up
And when THEy were down they were down
