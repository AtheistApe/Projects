    <h1>Colliding Balls</h1>
    <p>
      A number of "balls" of random size (mass) and color moving around
      the canvas under the effect of a varying gravitational field. When
      two balls collide, they bounce off each other exchanging their
      colors and the direction of the gravitational field rotates 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a constant gravitational field (both in direction and magnitude),
      the balls seem to "lose energy" and slow down when they collide with
      each other and with the "ground" (bottom of the canvas). I couldn't
      discern the reasons for this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to get the balls to make a collision sound when they collided
      but couldn't get it to work correctly; The sound occurs even when the
      balls don't make contact. I did get them to make sounds when contacting
      the edges of the canvas.
